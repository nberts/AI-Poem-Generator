          Eyes that last I saw in tears Through division Here in death's dream
          kingdom The golden vision reappears I see the eyes but not the tears
          This is my affliction This is my affliction Eyes I shall not see again
          Eyes of decision Eyes I shall not see unless At the door of death's
          other kingdom Where, as in this, The eyes outlast a little while A
          little while outlast the tears And hold us in derision.
